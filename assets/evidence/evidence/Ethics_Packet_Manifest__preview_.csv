Subject: Formal Notification of PPE Noncompliance and OSHA Escalation

Dear Amazon WHS Leadership,

This letter is to formally notify Amazon of what appears to be ongoing and systemic violations of OSHA workplace safety requirements under 29 CFR 1910.132. I am reporting the following specific compliance issues:

1. **Mandated PPE purchases through Zappos**, a company-preferred vendor.
2. **Partial financial reimbursement**, requiring employees to pay out-of-pocket for required flame-resistant (FR) safety gear.
3. **Lack of laundering services**, despite the critical nature of FR garment maintenance.
4. **No clear provision of on-site changing rooms or gear lockers**, despite expectation of daily wear/rotation.
5. **No alternative to ordering gear**, effectively mandating purchases and removing worker autonomy.

These actions constitute a transfer of legal and financial liability onto the worker and may represent a pattern of corporate negligence.

I am filing a formal complaint with OSHA and requesting immediate on-site review. Any retaliation, delay, or coercion will be interpreted as further grounds for federal whistleblower protection.

To Whom It May Concern,

This memo documents a series of formal warnings and direct communications provided by Ethan Womack (employee) to Amazon representatives regarding the improper routing of employment and benefits-related correspondence to a legally compromised address associated with a criminal estate trust.

Key Facts:
- The address on file is tied to individuals actively engaged in inheritance fraud, identity theft, and federal-level financial crimes exceeding $500,000.
- The employee provided written requests to redirect all correspondence to a verified secure mailing address.
- Slack messages, screenshots, and timestamped documentation exist proving Amazon’s internal failure to act promptly.
- Continued exposure puts Amazon at risk of becoming complicit in criminal conspiracy under data protection, identity theft, and privacy violation statutes.

Requested Action:
Immediate override of internal systems to guarantee all employee documentation is sent to the correct mailing address provided by the employee."

Dear Officials,

I, Ethan Womack, am requesting formal whistleblower protection under Florida law. I am an employee of Amazon working within the state and have reported the following:

1. That Amazon has continued to send sensitive personal and employment-related correspondence to an address tied to an ongoing federal-level criminal inheritance fraud operation involving my family.
2. That I have repeatedly notified internal Amazon staff of this situation, yet no meaningful action was taken until escalation occurred through Slack and public documentation.
3. That failure to act on this information places me at continued risk and may expose Amazon to criminal liability.

I request that this be formally investigated and that I be granted protection from retaliation or termination related to my disclosures.

The employee attempted to solve the issue through internal processes. Both representatives failed to act on warnings until public pressure was applied. Screenshots confirm systemic disregard for risk warnings."

Dear Officials,

I am submitting this formal request for whistleblower protection concerning a matter involving potential corporate negligence and criminal exposure by Amazon. I am an employee who has:

1. Reported to internal Amazon channels that my employment-related documents were being routed to an address compromised by a known estate fraud scheme tied to my family, already responsible for criminal acts involving nearly $500,000 in assets.

3. Collected evidence of systemic failure that may expose both myself and the company to legal, financial, and safety risks.

I am requesting protection from retaliation and a formal investigation into Amazon's handling of this matter.

Hi, it's Justin. I'm on the safety team. Ethan, nice to meet you. 

I think you know Anthony. We just wanted to talk to you. I know you had some concerns about the PPE and things along that line, so we just wanted to all get together and talk to you and see how we could help.

(1:05 - 1:31)
Um, are you asking what my concerns were? Yeah, we just wanted to talk through your concerns and like see how we could help address them. Um, the whole process for me, I don't know if you've ever gone through the whole OSHA 10-hour course and training and all that. Um, the whole process seems off to me.  ← ⚠️ OSHA Compliance Mentioned
