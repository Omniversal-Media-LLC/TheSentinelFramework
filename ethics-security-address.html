                    Subject: Formal Notification of PPE Noncompliance and OSHA Escalation

                    Dear Amazon WHS Leadership,

                    This letter is to formally notify Amazon of what appears to be ongoing and systemic violations of OSHA workplace safety requirements under 29 CFR 1910.132. I am reporting the following specific compliance issues:

                    1. **Mandated PPE purchases through Zappos**, a company-preferred vendor.
                    2. **Partial financial reimbursement**, requiring employees to pay out-of-pocket for required flame-resistant (FR) safety gear.
                    3. **Lack of laundering services**, despite the critical nature of FR garment maintenance.
                    4. **No clear provision of on-site changing rooms or gear lockers**, despite expectation of daily wear/rotation.
                    5. **No alternative to ordering gear**, effectively mandating purchases and removing worker autonomy.

                    These actions constitute a transfer of legal and financial liability onto the worker and may represent a pattern of corporate negligence.

                    I am filing a formal complaint with OSHA and requesting immediate on-site review. Any retaliation, delay, or coercion will be interpreted as further grounds for federal whistleblower protection.

                    To Whom It May Concern,

                    This memo documents a series of formal warnings and direct communications provided by Ethan Womack (employee) to Amazon representatives regarding the improper routing of employment and benefits-related correspondence to a legally compromised address associated with a criminal estate trust.

                    Key Facts:
                    - The address on file is tied to individuals actively engaged in inheritance fraud, identity theft, and federal-level financial crimes exceeding $500,000.
                    - The employee provided written requests to redirect all correspondence to a verified secure mailing address.
                    - Slack messages, screenshots, and timestamped documentation exist proving Amazon’s internal failure to act promptly.
                    - Continued exposure puts Amazon at risk of becoming complicit in criminal conspiracy under data protection, identity theft, and privacy violation statutes.

                    Requested Action:
                    Immediate override of internal systems to guarantee all employee documentation is sent to the correct mailing address provided by the employee.</div>

                    To: Florida Commission on Human Relations / Office of the Inspector General
                    From: Ethan Womack
                    Date: July 22, 2025

                    Subject: Request for Whistleblower Protection under Florida Statutes Chapter 112.3187

                    Dear Officials,

                    I, Ethan Womack, am requesting formal whistleblower protection under Florida law. I am an employee of Amazon working within the state and have reported the following:

                    1. That Amazon has continued to send sensitive personal and employment-related correspondence to an address tied to an ongoing federal-level criminal inheritance fraud operation involving my family.
                    2. That I have repeatedly notified internal Amazon staff of this situation, yet no meaningful action was taken until escalation occurred through Slack and public documentation.
                    3. That failure to act on this information places me at continued risk and may expose Amazon to criminal liability.

                    I request that this be formally investigated and that I be granted protection from retaliation or termination related to my disclosures.

                    Sincerely,
                    Ethan Womack

                    - July 19, 2025: Ethan Womack notifies Amazon representative Tori about the compromised address issue.
                    - July 21, 2025: Issue is raised again in Slack with Jon; escalation is deflected.
                    - July 22, 2025: Employee reiterates risk and receives delayed acknowledgment from Tori, who admits the ticket system was always available.

                    Summary:
                    The employee attempted to solve the issue through internal processes. Both representatives failed to act on warnings until public pressure was applied. Screenshots confirm systemic disregard for risk warnings.</div>

                    To: U.S. Office of Special Counsel / U.S. Department of Justice / Department of Labor – Whistleblower Protection Program
                    From: Ethan Womack
                    Date: July 22, 2025

                    Subject: Request for Whistleblower Protection under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989

                    Dear Officials,

                    I am submitting this formal request for whistleblower protection concerning a matter involving potential corporate negligence and criminal exposure by Amazon. I am an employee who has:

                    1. Reported to internal Amazon channels that my employment-related documents were being routed to an address compromised by a known estate fraud scheme tied to my family, already responsible for criminal acts involving nearly $500,000 in assets.
                    2. Provided clear written notice of the danger, only to have my warnings initially ignored or deferred until forced escalation.
                    3. Collected evidence of systemic failure that may expose both myself and the company to legal, financial, and safety risks.

                    I am requesting protection from retaliation and a formal investigation into Amazon&#x27;s handling of this matter.

                    Sincerely,
                    Ethan Womack

                    My family is engaged in an ongoing criminal scheme involving inheritance fraud and identity theft.

Amazon has been informed of this in writing multiple times and has failed to correct it promptly.
