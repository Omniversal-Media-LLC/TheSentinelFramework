# Sentinel Framework

**Operational Trust Meets Quantum Sovereignty**

Built by Omniversal Media, LLC | Powered by EverLightOS

## Overview

The Sentinel Framework represents a paradigm shift in organizational governance and technological sovereignty. Combining cutting-edge AI systems with archetypal wisdom traditions, it creates a living audit trail that transforms reactive governance into proactive sovereignty.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **EverLightOS**: Quantum substrata stabilization with federated Aether-Intelligence protocols
- **SphinxGuardian Protocol**: Mythic-technical documentation bridge integrating ancient wisdom with modern systems
- **Lattice Architecture**: Sierpinski Lattice foundation with magnetic mirror arrays and tri-wave forcefield mechanics

### Modular Systems

- **TechDoc-Agent**: Automated documentation generation and maintenance
- **APM-Assistant**: Application Performance Monitoring with predictive analytics
- **Sentinel Governance**: Policy enforcement and compliance monitoring with blockchain-verified audit trails

## Features

- ⚡ Quantum-level information processing and protection
- 🛡️ Multi-dimensional security with tri-wave forcefields
- 🔮 Archetypal pattern recognition and wisdom integration
- 📊 Real-time governance and compliance monitoring
- 🌐 Fractal scalability from micro to macro operations
- 🧠 AI-assisted decision making with ethical frameworks

## Deployment

### Static Site Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)

1. **Prepare the site:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all files are in the sentinel-framework directory
   # Verify all links and asset paths are correct
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:**
   - Zip the entire `sentinel-framework` folder
   - Upload via Cloudflare Pages dashboard
   - Configure custom domain if desired

3. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd sentinel-framework
   
   # Start a local server (Python)
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or use Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Access at http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Requirements

- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- HTTPS connection for PWA features
- Quantum-capable hardware for full EverLightOS integration (optional)
