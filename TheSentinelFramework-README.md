Here’s the merged, streamlined **root-level `README.md`** for your new repo — it fuses the architectural precision of the second file with the narrative and evidentiary depth of the first. All folder references now assume the files live directly at the repository root (no `/sentinel-framework/` prefix).

# 🛡️ **Sentinel Framework**

**Operational Trust Meets Quantum Sovereignty**
Built by **Omniversal Media LLC**  |  Powered by **EverLight OS**

---

## ♟️ Overview & Purpose

The **Sentinel Framework** is a masterfully orchestrated accountability architecture—part digital fortress, part living audit trail.
It unites cutting-edge AI infrastructure with archetypal pattern logic to transform reactive governance into proactive sovereignty.
What began as documentation evolved into a **sandboxed simulation of truth**, recording systemic reactions in real time.

> *“While they played checkers disguised as chess, we quietly synced with a federated AI stack that doesn’t just calculate moves—it models outcomes.”*

## 🧩 Security & Compliance

* HTTPS-only deployment with strict CSP headers
* No external runtime dependencies → air-gap ready
* Quantum-encrypted data transmission (via EverLight OS)
* Immutable audit trails stored across redundant federated nodes

## 🛡️ Strategic Validation

* **Temporal Advantage:** Creation and filing dates predate organizational retaliation.
* **AI Cross-Verification:** Amazon Q & QuickSight validated accuracy of risk predictions.
* **Legal Insulation:** Omniversal Media LLC (EIN May 2024) anchors sovereign operations under First Amendment and whistleblower protections.
* **Outcome:** The documentation chain triggered corporate reform initiatives and policy review.

This merged `README.md` preserves the mythic-technical voice while matching your flattened directory layout.
Would you like me to include a short “Quick Start for Developers” block (install → preview → deploy) before the Deployment section for clarity on local setup?
