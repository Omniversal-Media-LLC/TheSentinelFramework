      <div class="evidence-summary">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
          On <strong>October 8, 2025</strong>, an RME technician (Ethan Womack) cleared a jam on the ARSAW
          equipment. A Final Written Warning was later issued on <strong>October 13, 2025</strong>,
          alleging failure to follow LOTO requirements and categorizing the incident as a
          <strong>Category 1 safety violation</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The training document posted at the station and provided to the technician, the ARSAW
          Process Map Visual (PMV), states that for jam clearing activity the RME organization is
          <strong>not required</strong> to perform LOTO, and that LOTO is required for servicing,
          repair, or maintenance activities rather than routine jam clearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photographs of the ARSAW equipment taken before and after the incident show changes to
          tagging and signage on the access doors, including additional labels appearing after
          the incident and after the disciplinary action was issued.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2. Equipment Photographs -->

          and subsequent corrective action. These photographs are provided to help reviewers assess changes
          made to signage or tagging on the equipment.

      <div class="evidence-category">
        <h2>📋 ARSAW Training Documentation & Procedure</h2>
        <p>
          The ARSAW jam clearing procedure is defined in the ARSAW Process Map Visual (PMV) used for associate
          and RME training. The PMV covers Flow Lane, Infeed, and Outfeed jams, and distinguishes jam clearing
          from servicing, repair, and maintenance activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the section titled <strong>"DESTACKER AND LIFT JAMS"</strong>, the PMV includes the following
          instruction (emphasis added):
        </p>
        <blockquote class="document-quote">
          Note: For jam clearing activity the RME organization is not required to perform LOTO. For all other
          servicing, repair or maintenance activities LOTO is required.
