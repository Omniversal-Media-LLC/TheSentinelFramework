Proposal: Cross-Functional Resolution of Safety Protocol Inefficiencies
Submitted by: Ethan Ross Womack
Role: TPA4 Technician | RME / PMO Aligned
Case ID: 20250724-1576125
Date: July 25, 2025
1. Framing the Issue
The current security enforcement procedures at TPA4, while ostensibly focused on safety, are contributing to broader systemic inefficiencies. These issues intersect across WHS, RME, and PMO jurisdictions, affecting not only risk exposure but also morale, operational uptime, and cost control.
2. Stakeholder Perspectives
Department	Primary Lens	Key Talking Point
WHS	People & Policy	Protocol misapplication undermines safety and morale.
RME	Systems & Costs	Unclear or ineffective enforcement leads to training and maintenance waste.
PMO	Process & Governance	No owner spans intake-to-mitigation; gaps go unaddressed.
3. Safety-Morale-Leak Matrix
A simple 2x2 framework helps illustrate where we currently operate and the associated risks.
	Morale High	Morale Low
Safety Effective	🟩 Ideal State (Our Goal)	⚠️ Burnout Risk Zone
Safety Broken	⚠️ Overconfidence Risk Zone	🔴 Current State – Where We Are
4. Recommendation
Initiate a temporary cross-functional working group with representation from WHS, RME, and PMO to:
- Diagnose root-cause safety morale issues
- Quantify expenditure leakage
- Align on protocol redesign
- Establish permanent feedback and change management routing
