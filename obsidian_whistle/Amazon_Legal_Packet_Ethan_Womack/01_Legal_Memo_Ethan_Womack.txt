To Whom It May Concern,

This memo documents a series of formal warnings and direct communications provided by Ethan Womack (employee) to Amazon representatives regarding the improper routing of employment and benefits-related correspondence to a legally compromised address associated with a criminal estate trust.

Key Facts:

- The employee provided written requests to redirect all correspondence to a verified secure mailing address.
- Slack messages, screenshots, and timestamped documentation exist proving Amazon’s internal failure to act promptly.
- Continued exposure puts Amazon at risk of becoming complicit in criminal conspiracy under data protection, identity theft, and privacy violation statutes.

Requested Action:
Immediate override of internal systems to guarantee all employee documentation is sent to the correct mailing address provided by the employee.
