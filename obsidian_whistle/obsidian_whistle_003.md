# Obsidian Whistle - Entry 003
## 2025-07-18 | EW

Initial hope remains that files located in NA-US_SIGMA.md`and TPA4_ROUGELIST.md`are static onboarding filler -- not live-access databases.

However:
- Both files required Midway ZuKey autho to view.
- Network details and unit statuses appear dynamically generated.
- If these materials are live, access protocols are improperly tiered.

Recommendation (if live):
-> Immediate review by onboarding oversight team
-> Escalation to security development (SecDev)
-> Mandatory compliance briefing for both teams

Unaltered. Uninteracted.
Whistle is logged.
Care Package Assembled.
